# Distributions for Distance Sampling models in 'nimble'

This repository provides user-defined distributions that can be used to implement distance sampling models in nimble

* likelihoods for common distance-detection distributions including hazard-rate and half-normal

Suggestions for improvement and contributions of code are very welcome.
