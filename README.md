# Distributions for Distance Sampling models in 'nimble'

This repository provides some user-defined distributions that can be used to implement distance sampling models in nimble

* likelihoods for common distance-detection distributions including hazard-rate and half-normal

This is an experimental package in the early stages of development. Suggestions for improvement and contributions of code are very welcome.

## Installation Instructions

```
devtools::install_github("scrogster/nimbleDistance")
